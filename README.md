# Cheat Code Manager For Unity
This script keeps track of specific keyboard input (letters/alphabets and directional keys) in the scene and triggers relevant cheat methods if the correct cheat code is entered. Very basic script. Not optimised.

# How to?
1. Add the script to a game object in the scene (probably to the game manager game object).
2. Add your desired code in the Target code array.
3. Add a case in the 'ExecuteCode' method in the script with the target code as the case name.
4. Add your desired methods/statements inside the case which are to be executed when you enter the code.
5. Cheat!
